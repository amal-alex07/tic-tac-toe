# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game built with React! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players (X and O) take turns to fill a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player achieves three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when there is a tie.

## Features

Interactive 3x3 grid where players can click to place their mark ("X" or "O").
Displays the current game status: Next player, Winner, or Tie.
Ability to reset the game and start a new round.
Different colors for X and O on the board.
Message: "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe Game" at the top.
